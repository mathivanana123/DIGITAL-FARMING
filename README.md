                <h3>AGRO COMMUNITY </h3>
                <p>ACC is an innovative online platform designed to address 

                    the challenges faced by farmers, plant activists, gardening 
                    
                    enthusiasts in promoting sustainable agriculture practices 
                    
                    and fostering community engagement. The primary 
                    
                    problem faced by farmers and enthusiasts is the lack of 
                    
                    resources and tools to communicate, to raise awareness, 
                    
                    and resource sharing among gardening enthusiasts and 
                    
                    farmers.
